- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Navigate** to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:3000`

### Alternative Startup
For enhanced startup with additional logging:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Network Access
To allow other devices on your network to access the app:
1. Find your computer's local IP address (displayed in the console when starting)
2. Other devices can access via: `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.22:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start
- **Port 3000 already in use**: 
  - Change the port in `index.js` (line ~1285)
  - Or kill the process using port 3000: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

#### Can't Access from Other Devices
- **Firewall blocking**: Ensure your firewall allows connections on port 3000
- **Wrong IP address**: Verify the IP address shown in the console
- **Network restrictions**: Check if your router blocks local network communication

#### Objectives Not Loading
- **Corrupted data files**: Check `data_default.json` for valid JSON format
- **Missing files**: Ensure all required files are present in the project directory

#### Game State Not Saving
- **Permissions issue**: Ensure the `games/` directory is writable
- **Disk space**: Check available disk space
- **File corruption**: Verify `database.json` integrity

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading
- **Large game files**: Games with many objectives may load slower
- **Network congestion**: Reduce the number of connected devices
- **Browser cache**: Clear browser cache and refresh

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Small screens**: The app is designed for larger displays but works on mobile
- **Touch interactions**: Some features may require desktop for optimal use

### Data Management

#### Backup and Restore
- **Automatic backups**: Game states are automatically saved in the `games/` directory
- **Manual backup**: Copy `database.json` before major changes
- **Restore**: Replace `database.json` with a backup file

#### Custom Objectives
- **Adding objectives**: Follow the format in existing objectives
- **Unique IDs**: Ensure each objective has a unique identifier
- **Validation**: Test new objectives before using in live games
