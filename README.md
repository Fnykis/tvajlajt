A simple web application for managing Twilight Imperium 4 objectives and scoring. Designed to run locally and provide real-time game management. Players can connect to the session via their mobile device's browser to read objectives and view scoring.

The app is designed to be displayed on a large screen (TV/monitor) while allowing all players on the same WiFi network to access it from their mobile devices. Scoring and flipping cards can be done from any mobile device as long as they are "Superusers". Anyone can be superuser - let's trust each other (never said in a TI game).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start

#### Option 1: Git Clone (Recommended - Enables Auto-Updates)
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fnykis/tvajlajt.git
   ```
2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tvajlajt
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 2: Manual Download (No Auto-Updates)
1. **Download the ZIP file** from GitHub (click "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP")
2. **Extract** the ZIP file to your desired location
3. **Navigate** to the extracted folder in your terminal/command prompt
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
6. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:3000`

> **Note**: Only Git clone installations support automatic updates. Manual downloads will still work for version checking but cannot auto-download updates.

### Network Access
To allow other devices on your network to access the app:
1. Find your computer's local IP address (displayed in the console when starting and in the main menu in the UI)
2. Other devices can access via: `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.22:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start
- **Port 3000 already in use**: 
  - Change the port in `index.js` (line ~1285)
  - Or kill the process using port 3000: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

#### Can't Access from Other Devices
- **Firewall blocking**: Ensure your firewall allows connections on port 3000
- **Wrong IP address**: Verify the IP address shown in the console
- **Network restrictions**: Check if your router blocks local network communication

#### Objectives Not Loading
- **Corrupted data files**: Check `data_default.json` for valid JSON format
- **Missing files**: Ensure all required files are present in the project directory

#### Game State Not Saving
- **Permissions issue**: Ensure the `games/` directory is writable
- **File corruption**: Verify `database.json` integrity

### Performance Issues

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Small screens**: The app is not yet fully implemented to use with smaller screens but navigating the UI should work fine on mobile

### Update System

#### Auto-Updates (Git Clone Only)
- **Automatic version checking**: Server checks for updates after startup
- **Interactive updates**: Prompts user before downloading and installing
- **Automatic backups**: Creates backups before updating
- **Dependency management**: Automatically installs new dependencies

#### Version Checking (All Installations)
- **Version comparison**: Shows current vs. latest available version
- **Update notifications**: Warns when newer versions are available
- **Manual update option**: Users can manually download updates from GitHub

### Data Management

#### Backup and Restore
- **Automatic backups**: Game states are automatically saved in the `games/` directory
- **Update backups**: Automatic backups created before updates (Git installations only)
- **Manual backup**: Copy `database.json` before major changes
- **Restore**: Replace `database.json` with a backup file

#### Custom Objectives
- **Adding objectives**: Follow the format in existing objectives
- **Unique IDs**: Ensure each objective has a unique identifier
- **Update safety**: Custom content is preserved during updates
